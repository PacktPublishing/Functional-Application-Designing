## About the Video Course
Building Cross-Platform Web Applications with F# will guide you to develop a fully functional web application that includes server-side as well as client-side programming thanks to Fable, the F#-to-JavaScript compiler. We target the .NET Core platform so that your applications will work in a cross-platform manner.
This course takes you through a brief history of domain design and then jumps right into building a mini-application using CQRS. You will learn to set up and use Fable and Elmish as your SPA. Apart from this, you will get an introduction to server-side programming with F# and also learn how to perform next-generation unit testing with F#.
